May the force be with you.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
Fasten your seatbelts, It's going to be a bumpy night.
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices.
Every man dies, not every man really lives.
What we do in life echoes in eternity
The best way to guarantee a loss is to quit
Be so good they can’t ignore you.
I now do what other people only dream.
If you’re good at something, never do it for free.
I’m Gonna Make This Pencil Disappear.
You see, I’m not a monster. I’m just ahead of the curb.
What doesn’t kill you, simply makes you stranger.
Very poor choice of words.
Some people just want to see the world burn.
